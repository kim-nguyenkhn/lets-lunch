## Daily Development Routine 

Running `npm start` installs npm & pip dependencies, starts up the Python virtual env, and starts the app.

After you start the app, go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

When you're done developing, type `deactivate` to leave the Python virtual environment. 

```shell
# node v8
# npm v5
npm start

# Leave the virtual environment
deactivate
```

### Installing new dependencies

# Install a new npm dependency
npm install <DEPENDENCY>

# Install a new pip dependency
pip install <DEPENDENCY>
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
