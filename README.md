# Let's Lunch App!

Lunch roulette app built with React & Flask!

## Daily Development Routine 

Running `npm start` installs npm & pip dependencies, starts up the Python virtual env, and starts the app.

```shell
# node v8
# npm v5
npm start

# Leave the virtual environment
deactivate
```

### Installing new dependencies

```shell
# Install a new npm dependency
npm install <DEPENDENCY>

# Install a new pip dependency
pip install <DEPENDENCY>
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

After you start the app, go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
